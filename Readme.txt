Owning Mr. Content is like having a private butler for your blog or website. Simply upload articles and then watch as this plug-in turns your blog into a set it and forget it business asset. 

How would you like to be able to instantly upload hundreds of purchased or written articles and not have to worry about tagging posts, adding content on schedule, or ensuring that your site remains fresh and satisfying for your readers?

Forget manually finding and posting PLR content, forget about tagging every post individually or being chained to your desk, and forget working too hard to make use of the abundance of PLR content available online.

Just imagine what you could accomplish through having the ability to post all of your own unique content or PLR content, tag it, schedule it, and make it SEO optimized, all without lifting a finger after initial set up.

That is just what Mr. Content Plug-In is all about, and exactly what is making it one of the most efficient plug-ins for your online network. 

While there are other PLR plug-ins available on the market, they are either far too expensive, inefficient, or simply lack the power to take your websites to the next level. 

As if giving you the power to post all of your content on a set schedule was not already enough, this proven, popular, and reliable plug-in also:

* Tags all of the content added to your site for better search engine rankings in less time
* Utilizes a javascript method to improve the uniqueness of the content and give your site more authority with search engines.
* Creates new categories on your wordpress site based on your folders and the content you are utilizing.
* Allows you to upload large zip files packed full of content, and drip them onto your site.
* Offers flexible and fully customizable options in terms of how content is added, the schedule you want to use, and all kinds of setting and features to make your life easier.
* Ensures consistency with your sites, as you can set Mr. Content to a routine schedule and stick with it for as long as you wish, and as much content as you have. 

There is no better way to describe this powerful tool than as a truly set it and forget it plug-in. All you need to do is install the Mr. Content plu-gin, find PLR content, use the hordes of PLR content you already have, or write unique content of your own, set your posting schedule, and then sit back and watch it go to work.

An array of internet marketers and webmasters are already taking advantage of this plug-in, and neglecting this tool is a sure fire way to fall behind the competition.

You need content to make money; it's as simple as that. So why not reap all of the rewards while letting a plug-in do all of the work?

It just doesn't get any better than that. 

The longer you wait to harness the power of the Mr. Content Plug-In, the more time and money you are wasting. 

Let Mr. Content cater to your needs and your business, and start your day off right just like the perfect cup of coffee in the morning.
